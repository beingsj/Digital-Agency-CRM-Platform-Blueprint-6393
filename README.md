# Digital Agency CRM Platform Blueprint

This project contains a React-based CRM application built with Vite.

## Setup

Install the development and runtime dependencies using either `npm install` or `npm ci`:

```bash
npm install
# or
npm ci
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Linting (`npm run lint`) and building (`npm run build`) require the above dependencies, such as `@eslint/js`, to be installed.
